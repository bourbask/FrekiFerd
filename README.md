## 🔧 How to Use FrekiFerð

The script has three main commands to keep things simple:

### 1. Save Your Configuration 📝
Save the current package list and `.config` folder from your Manjaro OS.

```bash
./backup_script.sh save  
```

This creates a `manjaro_backup` folder in your home directory with:
- A list of your installed packages (`package_list_<timestamp>.txt`)
- A compressed copy of your `.config` folder (`config_backup_<timestamp>.tar.gz`)

### 2. Setup a New Computer for Restore ⚙️
If you're setting up a new Manjaro system, run this command to prepare a `manjaro_backup` folder in a specific location (like `~/Downloads` by default).

```bash
./backup_script.sh setup [optional_path]  
```

This creates a `manjaro_backup` folder where you can place your saved configuration files.

### 3. Restore Configuration on the New System 🔄
Once your backup files are in place, you can restore the configuration and packages on the new machine:

```bash
cd [path_to_backup_folder]  
./backup_script.sh restore  
```

This will:
- Install packages from your saved package list.
- Restore your `.config` settings (with a prompt before overwriting any existing files).

## 🛠 Customizing FrekiFerð

Want to adjust how *FrekiFerð* works? Here are some tweaks you can make:

- **Change Backup Directory**: You can modify `BACKUP_DIR` inside the script to use a custom location for backups.
- **Retention Policy**: By default, backups older than 30 days are automatically deleted. You can adjust this by editing the `-mtime +30` parameter in the `save_config` function.
- **Path for Setup**: When using the `setup` command, specify a custom path for the backup folder to better organize your files.
